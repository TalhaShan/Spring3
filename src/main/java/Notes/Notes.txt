1. Spring 3 uses micrometer that gives us more observable logs that can be use in grafana prometheus
2. ProblemDetail  class recently add for to check exception handling in Custom Exception Spring Boot
3. ObservationRegistry class @Autowired for micrometer details of business logic or ServiceLayer
4. Also need to enable actuator endpoints for that.
5. Now we HTTPExchange instead of RestClient and WeBClient that will use declaritve approach with interfaces
